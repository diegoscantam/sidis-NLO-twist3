We saw that factorization holds also at NLO .... bla bla\\
It is now interesting to numerically explore our analytical formulae to see if and how the NLO corrections affect the theoretical prediction of the spin asymmetry $A_{UT}^{\sin\phi_S}$. 

We stress the fact that the quantitative analysis of this SSA is quite a recent development in the field of QCD hadron structure and phenomenology. In fact, measurements of the $A_{UT}^{\sin\phi_S}$ asymmetry in SIDIS have become available from the HERMES collaboration in 2020 \cite{hermescollaboration2020azimuthalsingledoublespinasymmetries}. With this set of recent data, the JAM collaboration managed to obtain the first ever information about the quark-gluon-quark fragmentation function $\tilde{H}(z) $ within a global QCD analysis \cite{Gamberg2022Htilde}. We are now in a position


It is interesting to perform a numerical analysis of the leading-twist NLO cross section presented so far. In order to do so, one needs to access the relevant PDFs and FFs that show up in the formulae. When it comes to unpolarized PDFs, we use the MSTW 2008 PDF set presented in \cite{Martin2009}. For unpolarized fragmentation, we employ the DSS FF set \cite{deFlorian2007}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:f1D1}, curves for $f_1(x)$ and $D_1(z)$ are presented, showcasing different flavors contributions.

It is also interesting to study the leading-twist, unpolarized, triple differential cross section $\dd \sigma/\dd x_B \dd y \dd z_h$ at NLO. A plot of this cross section as a function of the different kinematical variables is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:plotNLOUUU}. We observe sizable NLO corrections to the LO cross section, especially at the edges of the phase space of the three kinematical variables. This is a common feature of NLO corrections in QCD.
