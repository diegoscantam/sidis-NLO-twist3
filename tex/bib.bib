	abstract = {Feynman amplitudes, regarded as functions of masses, exhibit various singularities when masses of internal and external lines are allowed to go to zero. In this paper, properties of these mass singularities, which may be defined as pathological solutions of the Landau condition, are studied in detail. A general method is developed that enables us to determine the degree of divergence of unrenormalized Feynman amplitudes at such singularities. It is also applied to the determination of mass dependence of a total transition probability. It is found that, although partial transition probabilities may have divergences associated with the vanishing of masses of particles in the final state, they always cancel each other in the calculation of total probability. However, this cancellation is partially destroyed if the charge renormalization is performed in a conventional manner. This is related to the fact that interacting particles lose their identity when their masses vanish. A new description of state and a new approach to the problem of renormalization seem to be required for a consistent treatment of this limit.},

The main feature of these processes is that the scattered lepton is not observed, so that the hard scale that makes them perturbative is set by the transverse momentum of the hadron or jet. Kinematically, the two processes thus become direct analogs of single-inclusive production in hadronic collisions which, as has been pointed out in the literature, makes them promising tools for exploring transverse spin phenomena in QCD when the incident nucleon is transversely polarized. We find that the NLO corrections are sizable for the spin-averaged cross section. We also investigate in how far the scattering is dominated by the exchange of almost real (Weizs{\textbackslash}"\{a\}cker-Williams) photons. We present numerical estimates of the cross sections for present-day fixed target experiments and for a possible future electron ion collider.},

We argue that those perturbative coefficient functions can, \{{\textbackslash}it a priori\}, acquire quite different yet Lorentz-invariant forms in various frames. This somewhat surprising difference can be traced back to a general dependence of the perturbative coefficient functions on lightcone vectors which are introduced by the twist-3 factorization formulae and which are frame-dependent. One can remove this spurious frame dependence by invoking so-called Lorentz invariance relations (LIRs) between twist-3 parton correlation functions. Some of those relations for twist-3 distribution functions were discussed in the literature before. In this paper we derive the corresponding LIRs for twist-3 fragmentation functions. We explicitly demonstrate that these LIRs remove the lightcone vector dependence by considering transverse spin observables in the single-inclusive production of hadrons in lepton-nucleon collisions, \${\textbackslash}ell N{\textbackslash}to hX\$. With the LIRs in hand, we also show that twist-3 observables in general can be written solely in terms of three-parton correlation functions.},

	abstract = {We analyze the transverse momentum dependent distribution and fragmentation functions in space-like and time-like hard processes involving at least two hadrons, in particular 1-particle inclusive leptoproduction, the Drell-Yan process and two-particle inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation. As is well-known, transverse momentum dependence allows for the appearance of unsuppressed single spin azimuthal asymmetries, such as Sivers and Collins asymmetries. Recently, Belitsky, Ji and Yuan obtained fully color gauge invariant expressions for the relevant matrix elements appearing in these asymmetries at leading order in an expansion in the inverse hard scale. We rederive these results and extend them to observables at the next order in this expansion. We observe that at leading order one retains a probability interpretation, contrary to a claim in the literature and show the direct relation between the Sivers effect in single spin asymmetries and the Qiu-Sterman mechanism. We also study fragmentation functions, where the process dependent gauge link structure of the correlators is not the only source of T-odd observables and discuss the implications for universality.},
